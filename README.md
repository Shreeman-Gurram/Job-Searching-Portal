# Job-Searching-Portal
The Job Portal Application enables recruiters to add, update, delete, and sort job postings while allowing job seekers to view detailed job descriptions and apply for jobs. The platform supports user roles for recruiters and job seekers, with job search enhanced through filtering or sorting options, such as filtering by job type or sorting by date.
